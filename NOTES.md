Create a comments section / component? like a forum?
FORUM PAGE would just be /forum
- show a list of threads/conversations? Would a thread be a model in rails? thread has many users and comments?
- click on each thread to bring you to /forum/:thread_id, shows the thread and form for new comment

or should forum just be one long thread?
- log in (log in regardless of which option I do)
- read all comments, form for new comment
- potentially, each conversation gets archived at the end of a day, or at like, 3am?
